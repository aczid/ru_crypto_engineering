This is the code repository for our first assignment of Cryptography Engineering at the Radboud Universiteit in Nijmegen.
We implemented the PRESENT cipher based on its publication paper, the C version by Zhu/Gong and the Leuven implementation in AVR.

The website for the course is: http://rucryptoengineering.wordpress.com
